<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The project is a task management application designed to help users efficiently organize, track, and prioritize their tasks. It enables users to break down larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks, set deadlines, and monitor their progress. The application ensures that users stay on top of their responsibilities while optimizing productivity and time management.</p>
<br>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>My purpose in creating this application is to practice my skills and knowledge in React.js, especially in using hooks and components.</p>
<p>I also applied some libraries to make the UI interactive, such as Framer Motion and Toastify.</p>
<p>About the storage of tasks data, It is stored in localStorage of the browser users</p>
<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Adding a Task</h3>
<p>The user needs to click the button in the upper-right corner of the screen to display the task form. After the form appears, the user must fill it out with the task details and then click the Add Task button in the bottom-right corner to save the task.</p>
<p>After a successful adding of tasks the application will toasts a message to inform users. If the users forget to fill out or enter invalid format on date field the users receive a warning message.</p>
<p>The application has a filtering feature where users can search for the tasks they are looking for, and it also has a sorting option in the right corner of the search bar to easily filter tasks based on the users' preferences.</p>
