<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The project is a comprehensive task management application designed to help users efficiently organize, track, and prioritize their tasks. It enables users to break down larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks, set deadlines, and monitor their progress. With intuitive features like task categorization, notifications, and real-time updates, the application ensures that users stay on top of their responsibilities while optimizing productivity and time management.</p>
<br>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>My purpose in creating this application is to practice my skills and knowledge in React.js, especially in using hooks and components.</p>
<p>I also applied some libraries to make the UI interactive, such as Framer Motion and Toastify.</p>
<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Adding a Task</h3>
<p>The user needs to click the button in the upper-right corner of the screen to display the task form. After the form appears, the user must fill it out with the task details and then click the Add Task button in the bottom-right corner to save the task.</p>
